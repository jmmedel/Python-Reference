Python Lists
Python Collections (Arrays)
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List is an collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.
When choosing a collection type, it is useful to understand the properties of that type.
 Choosing the right type for a particular data set could mean retention of meaning, and, 
 it could mean an increase in efficiency or security.

List
A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable. In Python lists are written with square brackets."""

"""Example
Create a List: """


thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

# Change the second item:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist[1] = "blackcurrant"
print(thislist)
