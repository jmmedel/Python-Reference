"""
Create a Child Class
To create a class that inherits the functionality from another class, send the parent class as a parameter when creating the child class:

Example
Create a class named Student, which will inherit the properties and methods from the Person class:
"""



class Student(Person):
  pass

"""
Note: Use the pass keyword when you do not want to add any other properties or methods to the class.
