Python Identity Operators
Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:

Operator	Description	Example	Try it
is 	Returns true if both variables are the same object	x is y	
is not	Returns false if both variables are the same object	x is not y """
