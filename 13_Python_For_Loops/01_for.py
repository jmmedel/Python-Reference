Python For Loops

Python For Loops
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming language, and works more like
 an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
Example
Print each fruit in a fruit list:"""

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)

"""
The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand, as the for command itself allows for this."""
